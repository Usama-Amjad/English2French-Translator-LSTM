# English_French_Translator_LSTM_Networks
In this hands-on project, we will train a Long Short Term (LSTM) Network to perform English to French Translation. This project could be practically used by travelers or people who are settling into a new country.

In this project, we completed the following tasks:

1-Understand the problem statement and business case  

2-Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

3-Perform data cleaning

4-Visualize datasets

5-Prepare the data by performing tokenization and padding

6-Understand the intuition behind recurrent neural networks

7-Understand the intuition behind LSTMs

8-Train an LSTM Model

9-Assess/evaluate trained model performance
