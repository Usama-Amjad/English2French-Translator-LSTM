# English_French_Translator_LSTM_Networks
In this hands-on project, we will train a Long Short Term (LSTM) Network to perform English to French Translation. This project could be practically used by travelers or people who are settling into a new country.

In this project, we completed the following tasks:

Understand the problem statement and business case  

Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

Perform data cleaning

Visualize datasets

Prepare the data by performing tokenization and padding

Understand the intuition behind recurrent neural networks

Understand the intuition behind LSTMs

Train an LSTM Model

Assess/evaluate trained model performance
